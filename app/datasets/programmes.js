Vaccinating children also protects others who are vulnerable to flu, such as babies and older people.\n\nThe vaccine is given as a nasal spray. This gives the most effective protection.\n\nSome children can have an injection instead, for example if they:\n\n- have had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of the nasal spray vaccine\n- have a severe egg allergy\n- have asthma that’s being treated with long-term steroid tablets\n- do not use gelatine or other animal products',
